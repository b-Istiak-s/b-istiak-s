### Hey! 

I'm Istiak. I've built [Khelboo](https://khelboo.com) (initially handling full-stack, later switched to backend) and [Oodaktar](oodaktar.com) (mostly backend and server management). 
I thrive in logic and speed-execution. 
Other than coding, I overthink everything, LITERALLY EVERYTHING! 
Initially, when I see a business, I make a plan of mine, why they will succeed. Sometimes, I analyze why they might fail as well; however, that's not given, as they could turn it into something better. Generally, I tend not to share why they are likely to fail, or sometimes I don't have the time to think, or other times, my brain can't find a flaw without knowing anything internal. 

I've a few plans for now, if you would like to build any of the following or if you have any ideas, hit me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/istiak-ahmed-6251b6255/)

- A 3D social media
- Make long-distance relationships sustainable with a 3D platform (essentially gamifying the relationship)
- AI-powered keyboard
- (Good) Search enine for dark web (the current ones are quite bad)

-------------------------------------
- Sometimes, I write poems too, but you won't see 99.99% of my poems, as I write them under a pseudoname. 
- Logic > everything; for me.
